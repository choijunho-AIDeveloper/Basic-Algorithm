# Basic Algorithm & Data Structure Study

This repository contains Python code for solving various algorithm and data structure problems, primarily from the Baekjoon Online Judge. It serves as a personal study log for implementing and understanding core computer science concepts.


## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories: `Algorithm` and `DataStructure`. Each category contains subdirectories for specific topics, which in turn hold the Python source code for solved problems.
